# dwtk-makefile

A generic Makefile for AVR projects using dwtk.


## How to use

Just copy `Makefile` and `dwtk-config.mk` files to your project and adapt `dwtk-config.mk` to fit your project. The settings are mostly self-explanatory.

The example `dwtk-config-local.example.mk` local configuration file is also useful, but not required.


## Usage examples

There's a very simple example in the `examples/` folder. The [`dwtk-ice`](https://github.com/dwtk/dwtk-ice) firmware is also a good example.
